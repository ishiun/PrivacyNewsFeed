Simple news feed app that pulls data from NewsAPI (https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything) and displays in a table. Redirects to article on cell click.

## Further Considerations 
The main issue I had was simply the time constraints. In 3 hours it is possible to make a functioning application however to proper check over code, proper testing, and proper documentation would not be possible in this time span. 

For future enhancements, UI would definately be something to work upon.
